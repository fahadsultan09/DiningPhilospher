# Getting Started:
Mutual exclusion is the basic idea of the problem, the Dining philosophers create a generic and abstract scenario useful for explaining issues of this type. 

# Prerequisites:
This project requires a software that can support .C and implemented kernel to perform your own system call.

# Deployment:
Processes that require synchronization to interact properly  manage . However, the concurrent processes that interact, there are some problems to be solved such as deadlock and synchronization. One of the classic problems that can explain the problem Philosophers Problem.

# About:
Dining Philosophers Problem can be illustrated as follows:

There are five philosophers who would eat. On the table was reserved chopsticks. If really hungry philosophers, then it will take two chopsticks, which is in the right and left hands.

However, sometimes only one race takes chopsticks. If there are philosophers who took two chopsticks, then there are philosophers who have to be patient until the chopsticks are placed back. Inside this problem, there is the possibility of deadlock, a state in which two or more processes can not remain execution.

Installing:
1.Install VMware (https://www.vmware.com/)
2.Add .iso file and create a new user
3.On terminal, compile it with gcc -o obj final.c
4.now, " ./obj"
5.You will get the desire output 

Problems:
Some problems can be faced during compilation of systemcall so refer to the above youtube link.
